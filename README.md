## Advent of Code 2020

I challenged myself to solve [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)
in a different programming language every day. Here's some thoughts:

#### Day 1: [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python)

At this point, I had no intentions of using multiple languages. I should've
saved this one for later.

#### Day 2: [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))

I had no intentions of using multiple languages either. But I wanted to do
things in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) before it
gets too complicated.

#### Day 3: [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)

This day I decided to use multiple languages as I saw an oportunity to do
brainfuck before things get complicated.

I found no interpreter/compiler that worked on my machine so I did my own and
added support for multiple input streams to read directly from an input file.

It was very rough, I gave up at some point and got some bash to help me. But
I'm happy with the result, I'm not doing
[esoterics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language)
anymore...

#### Day 4: [F#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language))

For this day I wanted to try something new but not that crazy. I've never
used this language, but my previous experience with the .net environment really
helped.

I struggled a lot with the algorithms since everything was unmutable but
[Linq](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/linq/) came to help. I
found it extremely difficult to handle null values: I don't like that.

Performance sucks but I'm glad that it works and I still have plenty of hair.

#### Day 5: [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language))

I struggled a lot for this day! Mostly selecting the language than anything else:
I wanted something new and challenging but I was very lazy. I had
[Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) and
[Cobol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL) at the top of my head and almost
attempted using [Oak](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/oakc).

I like [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)): it
shares some familiarities with [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
with a very clean and minimalist syntax that I really liked. Except for their
horrible lambda functions, at least they're better than
[Python's](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-lambda/)...
