## Advent of Code 2020

I challenged myself to solve AOC-2020 in a different programming language every
day. Here's some thoughts:

#### Day 1: [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python)

At this point, I had no intentions of using multiple languages. I should've
saved this language for later.

#### Day 2: [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))

I had no intentions of using multiple languages either. But I wanted to do
things in C before it gets too complicated.

#### Day 3: [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)

This day I decided to use multiple languages as I saw an oportunity to do
brainfuck before things get complicated.

I found no interpreter/compiler that worked on my machine so I did my own and added
support for multiple input streams to read directly from an input file.

It was very rough, I gave up at some point and got some bash to help me. But
I'm happy with the result, I'm not doing esoteric anymore...
